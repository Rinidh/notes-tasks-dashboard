üìå Mini Project Idea: Notes & Tasks Dashboard with API Integration:

A small app that lets users:

Fetch suggested motivational quotes (from an external API).
  A button for fetching a random quote (turns into note) & a button for creating new note

Create personal notes or tasks (stored in local state).
  Arrange all notes in grid

Use a reducer for managing task state (add, toggle complete, delete).

Use context to share global settings (like theme or username).

Use refs for input focus.

Extract a custom hook for API fetching.

This mimics the functionality of a real productivity app, and you could later integrate it into a larger app (like a personal planner, or even a shop dashboard for tasks/orders).

üõ†Ô∏è Key Hook Usage

useState ‚Üí For local note/task inputs.

useReducer ‚Üí For managing tasks with multiple actions.

useEffect ‚Üí To fetch a motivational quote from an API (like quotable.io
).

useContext ‚Üí Provide global settings (like theme mode: light/dark, or user profile info).

useRef ‚Üí Focus the input box after adding a new task.

Custom Hook ‚Üí useFetchQuote() that handles fetching and error/loading states.
